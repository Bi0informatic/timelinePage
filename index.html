                <h2>Here is a timeline that lead to this image:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>2025</b> - Gus was requested for a hug, but he was terrified. 
                        The utter mention of such an action drove fear deep into the depths of his heart. 
                        An electric shock coursed down from his brain and followed his spine to the ends of his tail;
                        this signal instantly poofed up his tail. Summoning all his courage, he decides not to yield.
                        Gus gets into prowl position and stalks his attacker. Then he bolts past the attacker and slides 
                        hitting head first into a door. He blacks out.    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2029</b> - After a four year coma, Gus wakes up momentarily in a hospital room.
                        He looks around in a daze and quickly loses consciousness again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2030</b> - Gus wakes up again, but this time sound of mind (as sound of mind as a cat could be). 
                        He notices a window is open and jumps out to make his escape. Fortunately, he was on the ground floor
                        and because he did not land on his feet. Years of coma left his muscles atrophied, but his will was strong.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2032</b> - Gus has now been living on the streets for two years now. He's been hunting stupid birds and drinking 
                        water from those dog water fountains. Gus now controls a territory of five blocks. How did he do it? Who knows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2033</b> - It's been three years since Gus took to the streets. He is a changed cat now.
                        He has seen stuff. Street stuff. Unmentionable horrors. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2050</b> - Twenty years have passed since Gus escaped the hospital. He is now on his deathbed surrounded by his adopted
                        family for he was neutered at a young age and unable to reproduce. His family numbers the hundreds as they gather to wish his 
                        farewell from the mortal realm. His body weakens as the hours drag on. His now fully white fur begins to lose its sheen.
                        Gus closes his eyes and remembers the moment when a someone utter the word "hug". He curls up and puts his paws on his head. Mortified. Ashamed. Hiding. 
                        This is what led to the image (imagine the Gus in the image has only white fur).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2025</b> - Gus then wakes up from banging his head on the door and goes to eat his daily dinner. 
                        It was all a dream! Cats can't live for like 25 years. I think. Since it's currently 2025 and he was born in 2024,
                        his journey is still beginning. Who knows what Gus will accomplish in his life. I know. He will be fat cat.
