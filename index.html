                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>2025</b> - Gus was requested for a hug, but he was terrified. 
                        The utter mention of such an action drove fear deep into the depths of his heart. 
                        An electric shock coursed down from his brain and followed his spine to the ends of his tail;
                        this signal instantly poofed up his tail. Summoning all his courage, he decides not to yield.
                        Gus gets into prowl position and stalks his attacker. Then he bolts past the attacker and slides 
                        hitting head first into a door. He blacks out.    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2029</b> - After a four year coma, Gus wakes up momentarily in a hospital room.
                        He looks around in a daze and quickly loses consciousness again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2030</b> - Gus wakes up again, but this time sound of mind (as sound of mind as a cat could be). 
                        He notices a window is open and jumps out to make his escape. Fortunately, he was on the ground floor
                        and because he did not land on his feet. Years of coma left his muscles atrophied, but his will was strong.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>2032</b> - Gus has now been living on the streets for two years now. He's been hunting stupid birds and drinking 
                        water from those dog water fountains. Gus now controls a territory of five blocks. How did he do it? Who knows.
